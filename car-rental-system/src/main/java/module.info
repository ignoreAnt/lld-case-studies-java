module com.ignoreant.carrentalsystem {
    // For now, this module doesn't export any packages or require other specific modules
    // from our project. We will add 'exports' and 'requires' clauses as needed.

    // If you plan to use libraries that are not yet fully modular (i.e., automatic modules)
    // and your code needs to access them via reflection for testing (e.g. Mockito with JUnit),
    // you might need 'opens' clauses for your test module later.
    // e.g., opens com.ignoreant.carrentalsystem.service to org.junit.jupiter.api, org.mockito;

    // For now, we'll keep it simple.
